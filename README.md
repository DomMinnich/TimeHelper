# Time Helper GUI
---
Sooo a clock in service I use does clock ins by minutes which can lead to some interesting hourly times like 8.21 or 9.03 which by the last work day could be hard to figure out how long your last day would be without going into overtime and going under your total. This app helps this!

A Python-based time management application developed by **Dominic Minnich**. This GUI tool lets you:
- Specify a **weekly target** of working hours.
- Track **hours worked** each day.
- Calculate **remaining hours** needed to meet your weekly goal.
- Visualize a **work period** via a pair of sliders (start/end time).

Enjoy a fade-in window effect, custom ttk theme styling, and real-time updates as you enter data.
